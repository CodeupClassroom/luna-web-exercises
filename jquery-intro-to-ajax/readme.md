# Ajax

- Context / what is this? Why is it popular?
    - AJAX: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
        - These days JSON is way more popular
    - SPA: Single Page Application
- JSON as a *data interchange format*
- Data flow: DB -(SQL)> backend -(JSON)> frontend -(JS/HTML)> user
- Requests + Responses
    - `$.ajax`
    - `$.get` (`$.post`)
- Note: for the exercises, we'll send requests to a `.json` file to simulate a web server's response
- Demo
    - Simple example: https://ajax-demo.zach.wiki
    - [Diagrams](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11Xy5ENnVNG1gAC1m7_LwYcCsuuXyMYlGL9MHi5SA8LI/edit?usp=sharing)
    - More complex example: https://ajax-demo.zach.wiki/featured-items
    - (if time) `coffee.json`
- Additional Exercises
    - Show a "loading..." message when the request is sent. This message should dissapear once the response has been received.
    - Play with the [star wars api](https://swapi.dev/)
    - Search and find other public APIs that you can interact with
