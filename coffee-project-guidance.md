# Coffee Project

- Context: in this project, you will be getting an existing codebase and making changes to it. This is much more
  real-world than starting from scratch
- Read the existing code! Understand how it works; #1 mistake by students
- start with the TODOs, then do the bonuses

## Additional Guidance

After the initial setup and some time spent exploring the codebase, but
**before** you start working on the TODOs, divide these questions up among your team and answer them:

- What does the `renderCoffee` function do? Where is it used?
- What does the `renderCoffees` function do? Where is it used?
- What does the `updateCoffees` function do? Where is it used?
- Explain the structure of the `coffees` variable. Where is this variable used?
- What is the contents of the `tbody`, `submitButton`, and `roastSelection`
  variables? Where are they used?
- Explain the structure of the HTML page. What do you notice?

After answering the above questions, you should have a good understanding of how the existing application works. Next
take a look at each of the new features you are going to implement. For each of the new features, answer the following
questions:

- Using precise technical vocabulary, explain in plain english at a high level how you will implement the change.
- How long do you think it will take you to implement this feature?
- What parts of the existing codebase will you need to change? Will you need to add any new sections to the existing
  code?

## Team Workflow Review

One Teammate:

1. Creates a github organization
1. Invites the other team member
1. Forks [the coffee-project](https://github.com/gocodeup/coffee-project) to their organization)

Both Teammates

1. Clone the forked repo
1. Work on the existing codebase
1. Add and commit their work (`git add`, `git commit`)
1. Pull to get changes into their local files (`git pull origin master`)
1. Push their work up to GitHub (`git push origin master`)
